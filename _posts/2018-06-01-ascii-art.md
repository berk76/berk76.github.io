I like old computers and programming so I decided to join programming competition [Create game for DOS 2017](https://www.high-voltage.cz/2017/soutez-tvorba-hry-pro-dos-2017/). One of requirements was that game needs to be in text mode so I started thinking how to draw some simple pictures in text mode. During googling on Internet I discovered work of woman with initials `jgs` and I got fascinated by her web containing a lots of amazing pictures and awesome articles about ASCII art.

Initials `jgs` belongs to woman - American ASCII artist - Joan G. Stark, also known by her pseudonym `Spunk`. According to wikipedia, Stark was first exposed to the art of ASCII in the summer of 1995 and by July 1996 had taken to the creation of ASCII art. From 1996 to 2003 she created several hundred works of art, most of which were posted to the Usenet newsgroup `alt.ascii.art` (see [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_Stark)).

Her original web was hosted at `http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/7373` but now it is available only through [web archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20091028013825/http://www.geocities.com/SoHo/7373/) or as project on [github](https://github.com/oldcompcz/jgs) (as kind of restoration initiative). Here are several amazing articles about ASCII art and about herself.

Back to my programming competition - finally I decided to create variations of Tetris game and I have used some ASCII pictures with simple animations and game [reached to third piosition](https://www.high-voltage.cz/2017/soutez-tvorba-hry-pro-dos-2017-dobojovano/).
